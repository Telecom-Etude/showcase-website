### Style Guidelines

- Code Style: Follow Next.js best practices and use ESLint and Prettier.
- Formatting: Ensure code is formatted using the project's Prettier configuration.
    - If you use _vscode_, some extensions will be recommended when you install the project: please install them.
    - Otherwise, personally make sure your code is formatted and is correct relatively to the [.prettierrc] and [.eslintrc.json] files.
    - To format your code, run `npm run fmt`

### Commit Messages

Follow the Conventional Commits format:

```txt
action: what the commit does
```

For instance, if you fix the redirection callback on the signin page, a good commit name is

```txt
fix: redirection callback on the signin page
```

Naming a commit can be hard, for this, you can try to complete the sentence _This commit will..._. The verb after _will_ is your action, and the rest of the sentence is what you can put after the colon. Again with our previous example, you can say _This commit will **fix** the redirection callback on the signin page_.
